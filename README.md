# PECAP_PhD_Thesis
Database containing python and MATLAB scripts for collecting Electrically-Evoked Compound Action Potentials 
  relevant for the Panoramic ECAP ("PECAP") Method as described in Charlotte Garcia's Ph.D. Dissertation.
  The dissertation can be found at the following location: https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.89113.

Appendix B of the PECAP PhD Thesis describes the procedures for collecting PECAP data that was followed for 
  the purposes of the various studies described in the thesis.
Section B.5 outlines the online resources. The files in this directory provide PECAP data-collection scripts 
  for Cochlear Ltd and Advanced Bionics Cochlear Implant Users.
